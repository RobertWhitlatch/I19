The following is an outline of what to do to connect a PocketBeagle to the internet via the USB cable to a Windows 10 desktop which is connected to the Internet via hardwire Ethernet.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ethernet over USB Tether Gadget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is to connect a PocketBeagle to the Internet through the USB connection to a Windows 10 desktop, which is connected by hardwire Ethernet to the Internet.

I used 'Etcher' to load a fresh copy of the latest 'stretch' version of Debian 9.1 onto the Pocketbone.
bone-debian-9.1-iot-armhf-2017-10-01-4gb.img

Plug the PocketBeagle into an open USB port on your Windows 10 desktop

The four LEDs should start blinking, and after about a minute or so, a new USB serial device should appear in Device Manager\Ports(COM&LPT), and a new Remote NDIS Compatible Device should appear in Device Manager\Network Adaptors

Also, a new Ethernet interface will appear in Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections.
It will be described as "Unidentified Network", Remote NDIS Compatible Device

Use Putty to connect to the new COM port
log into the PocketBeagle

now type
sudo /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1

Now, on the Windows 10 desktop,
go to and open your primary Ethernet interface:   Ethernet\Properties\Sharing\
Check the two sharing boxes.
Enter the name of the new NDIS Device interface into the box. [In my case it was Ethernet 2 ]
Click 'OK' and exit the interface box

Now open the Unidentified Network\NDIS Device interface\Properties\Internet Protocol Version 4\Properties
Click 'Use the following IP address'
Enter 192.168.7.1 as the IP address
Enter 255.255.255.0 as the Subnet Mask

Click 'Use the following DNS server addresses'
Enter 8.8.8.8 as the Preferred DNS server.
Click 'OK' and 'Close' to exit

Now go to the PocketBeagle command line on Putty
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
down-arrow to get past the comment line
enter 'nameserver 8.8.8.8'       [without the quotes]
enter <return>
enter <control-X>, then 'Y', <return> to exit    [without the quotes]

The Ethernet tether gadget should be operational.
To test, type 'ping google.com' in the command line. [without the quotes]
It should run and see the ping replies.
type <control-c> to abort.

You should now have internet access and can 
sudo apt-get update

The two entries in the PockBeagle are not persistent, so after any reboot,
you will have to repeat the two entries in the PocketBeagle to get the 
internet tether gadget running again.
